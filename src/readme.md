##Blackjack card game
This project is a console based blackjack card game forked from DerekSomerville (https://github.com/DerekSomervilleUofG/PythonOOCardGames)

It includes some generic card game functionality that can be re-used across other card games.

###What is my aim?
I was tasked with adding unit tests to the methods within the PlayingCard functionality and the Blackjack functionality.

I was also tasked with incorporating an Adapter design pattern (more to follow on this).

##Rules of the game
The rules for this game can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack
